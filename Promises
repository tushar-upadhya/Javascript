Q.   What is Promise in JavaScript?
Ans. promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future. Either a resolved value or a rejected value.
     promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully 
     completed or not.


Promise has three possible states:

A promise starts in the pending state, which indicates that the Promise hasnâ€™t been completed yet.
It ends with either resolved/fulfilled (successful) or rejected (failed) state.



Benefits of Promises

Improves Code Readability
Better handling of asynchronous operations
Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
Better Error Handling


Promise Chaining
You can perform an operation after a promise is resolved using methods then(), catch() and finally().

The then() method is used with the callback when the promise is successfully fulfilled or resolved.



The syntax of then() the method is:

promiseObject.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);


JavaScript catch() method
The catch() method is used with the callback when the promise is rejected or if an error occurs.
